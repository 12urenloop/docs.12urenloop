# 2020-2021

Specific documents of the edition in the academic year 2020-2021.

## Cancelled


This specific edition was cancelled due to the spreading COVID-19 virus. Not much development was done due to the lack of posibilities inside Zeus to organise codenight or come together to work on the project. The hardware aspects make it difficult to do development completely remote.

Without the costs of the event budget was made available for the IT-team to improve our equipment. We were already working on a new concept for software and hardware and took the opportunity to not only buy these new hardware parts but also upgrade the general IT equipment. This includes a Core setup of a router+switch+ups to be sure the most important parts keep running smoothly when power problems occur (and they occur).

## Alternative edition

Strava.
